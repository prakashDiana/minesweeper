SF Pro Rounded falls squarely on the side of **strict licensing**, not "chill" licensing.

Here's a breakdown of why its licensing is so restrictive:

* **Proprietary Apple Font:** SF Pro Rounded is a proprietary typeface owned by Apple. This means Apple holds the copyright and controls all aspects of its usage and distribution.
* **Highly Restrictive EULA:** The End User License Agreement (EULA) for these fonts is very specific and limited. It typically permits developers to use the fonts **only for creating mock-ups of user interfaces for software products running on Apple's operating systems** (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS).
* **Prohibition on General Use:** The EULA expressly **prohibits** using the font for purposes outside of this narrow scope. This includes:
    * Embedding it as a web font on a general website.
    * Using it in logos, branding, or other marketing materials.
    * Incorporating it into software running on non-Apple platforms (e.g., Windows, Android, Linux).
* **Intellectual Property Protection:** Apple's San Francisco font family is a core part of its brand identity. By keeping its use tightly controlled, Apple protects its unique visual signature and maintains a premium, exclusive feel for its products.

In contrast, a "chill" license would be something like the **SIL Open Font License (OFL)**, which governs fonts like Latin Modern Roman. An OFL allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the font for both personal and commercial projects, with very few restrictions.

Therefore, you should never assume you can use SF Pro Rounded freely. Its licensing is one of the most restrictive in the world of typefaces.
